# üìò Understanding REST and Its Constraints

## What is REST?

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style defined in the year 2000 by **Roy Fielding** in his Ph.D. thesis. Fielding, one of the main authors of the HTTP protocol, proposed REST as a set of **constraints** or **best practices** for designing scalable and maintainable web services.

REST is not a protocol or standard, but a set of architectural guidelines to make better use of the existing standards of the web, like HTTP and URIs.

## üîë REST Architectural Constraints

For an API to be considered RESTful, it should follow these core **constraints**:

---

### 1. üì° Client-Server

This constraint enforces the **separation of concerns**:

- **Client** is where the user interacts (usually the frontend).
- **Server** handles business logic and data processing (backend).

This separation allows both to evolve independently, improving scalability and modularity.

---

### 2. üö´ Stateless

Each request from the client to the server **must be independent**. That means:

- The server **does not store session information** between requests.
- Each request must include all the necessary data for it to be processed.

This simplifies server design and improves scalability, since the server doesn't need to remember previous interactions.

### 3. ‚ö° Cacheable

To improve performance, RESTful systems should allow **response caching**:

- Responses must define whether they can be cached.
- Cached responses reduce the need to reprocess identical requests (like homepage rendering).

Example:
- Instead of fetching and rendering a homepage every time, we store a version in the cache for quicker retrieval, reducing database and CPU usage.

### 4. üé® Uniform Interface

This is **one of the most important constraints** and distinguishes REST from other architectural styles.

Key principles:

- **Resource-Based URIs**: Identify resources using nouns (e.g., `/users`, `/orders/123`)
- **Standardized HTTP Methods**:
  - `GET` ‚Äì Retrieve resource
  - `POST` ‚Äì Create new resource
  - `PUT` ‚Äì Update full resource
  - `PATCH` ‚Äì Partial update
  - `DELETE` ‚Äì Remove resource
- **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Each message (request/response) includes enough information for understanding without external context.
- **HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)**: Responses can include links to other related actions/resources (e.g., `next`, `previous`, `update`, etc.).

---

### 5. üèóÔ∏è Layered System

This constraint allows the architecture to be **composed of multiple layers**, each with a specific responsibility.

Examples:
- **Load balancers**
- **Proxy servers**
- **Authentication layers**
- **Caching layers**

The client doesn't need to know if it‚Äôs directly communicating with the origin server or through intermediate layers. This provides:
- Better **scalability**
- Improved **security**
- Easier **maintenance**

---

### 6. üß© Code-On-Demand (Optional)

Unlike the other constraints, this one is **optional**.

The idea is to allow servers to deliver **executable code** (like JavaScript) to the client, enabling more dynamic and flexible behavior on the client side.

Example:
- A server could send JavaScript to a web browser that enhances interactivity or automates part of the UI.
